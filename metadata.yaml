description: "Scaramouche is an historical novel by Rafael Sabatini, originally published\
  \ in 1921. A romantic adventure, Scaramouche tells the story of a young lawyer during\
  \ the French Revolution. In the course of his adventures he becomes an actor portraying\
  \ \"Scaramouche\" (a roguish buffoon character in the commedia dell'arte). He also\
  \ becomes a revolutionary, politician, and fencing-master, confounding his enemies\
  \ with his powerful orations and swordsmanship. He is forced by circumstances to\
  \ change sides several times. The book also depicts his transformation from cynic\
  \ to idealist.\nThe three-part novel opens with the memorable line: \"He was born\
  \ with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad.\" This line was to\
  \ become Sabatini's epitaph, on his gravestone in Adelboden, Switzerland.\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
